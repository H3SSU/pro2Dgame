crouch jump = jump higher than normal.
put the red ball next to a block and press Lshift, A or D, spacebar at the same time and keep pressing them to use cool jump mechanism and jump higher than crouch jump. when you are close to enemies wait for a while for their bullets to work better you can confirm it by looking at the bullets when they are going 1 bullet per 0.75seconds
very hard game! dont rage.....
